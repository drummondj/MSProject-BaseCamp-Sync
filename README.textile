h1. MSProject-Basecamp-Sync

This project is a Visual Basic module that I wrote for MSProject to send task and 
milestone information to Basecamp. Basecamp is an awesome project management system
made by 37signals - http://www.basecamphq.com

h1. Overview

After installation (see below) the macro will perform the following sequence of events:

# Each milestone in the projected is synced. The milestone name, deadline and responsible party are sent to Basecamp. A todo list is created for each milestone.
# Then each task for the milestone 

h1. Installation

h2. Importing the class file

You need to import the class file into each MSProject file you want to sync.

# Download the MSProject-Basecamp-Sync.cls file from github.
# Open your MSProject file
# Click on the Tools -> Macro -> Visual Basic Editor menu or press Alt+F11
# From the Visual Basic editor window, click on the File -> Import File ... menu or press Ctrl+M
# Select the MSProject-Basecamp-Sync.cls file and click Open
# A new folder called "Class Modules" will appear. Expand the folder and double-click the MSProject-Basecamp-Sync icon
# At the top of the file you need to edit the SERVER_URL, API_KEY and PROJECT_NAME constants.
## The PROJECT_NAME constant must match exactly the name if the project in Basecamp.
# After you have edited the constants you can click the Save icon and close the Visual Basic Editor.

h2. Adding a button to you MSProject toolbar

You only need to do this once and a button will be available for all your projects.
